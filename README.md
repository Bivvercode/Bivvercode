# Hi, I'm Bivvercode ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a passionate Software Developer specializing in mobile app and backend development. My expertise lies in Python and Django, where I focus on building robust and scalable backend architectures.

With a strong foundation in Swift, SwiftUI, Kotlin, and Compose, I have transitioned my focus towards backend development. Leveraging Python and Django, I craft impactful solutions and ensure the delivery of high-quality applications. I'm also proficient in AWS services including Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, RDS, and S3, which helps me maintain efficient and scalable infrastructures.

Driven by curiosity, I continuously explore new technologies and methodologies, particularly in the field of machine learning. My academic background provides me with solid fundamentals in app architecture and coding best practices, which I apply in every project I undertake.
