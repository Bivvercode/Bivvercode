# Hi, I'm Bivvercode üëã

## About Me

I'm a passionate Software Developer specializing in mobile app and backend development. My expertise lies in Python and Django, where I focus on building robust and scalable backend architectures.

With a strong foundation in Swift, SwiftUI, Kotlin, and Compose, I have transitioned my focus towards backend development. Leveraging Python and Django, I craft impactful solutions and ensure the delivery of high-quality applications. I'm also proficient in AWS services including Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, RDS, and S3, which helps me maintain efficient and scalable infrastructures.

Driven by curiosity, I continuously explore new technologies and methodologies, particularly in the field of machine learning. My academic background provides me with solid fundamentals in app architecture and coding best practices, which I apply in every project I undertake.

## Key Projects

### [E-commerce Backend](https://github.com/Bivvercode/ecommerce-backend)
E-commerce Backend is a comprehensive project designed to mimic real-world e-commerce scenarios. Developed primarily as a learning tool for myself, it also serves as an open resource for others to study, learn, and practice their backend development skills. The aim is to provide a robust and scalable backend solution that frontend developers can use to build their own mock frontends, enabling them to handle real-world situations without worrying about finding another backend to integrate with.

**Features:**
- User authentication and authorization
- Product management (CRUD) (In progress)
- Order management (Upcoming)
- Inventory management (Upcoming)
- Payment integration (simulated) (Upcoming)

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Python with Django for building APIs and handling business logic.
- Database: SQLite3 for storing product and user data.
- API Framework: Django Rest Framework (DRF) for building RESTful APIs.
- Testing Framework: Pytest for writing and running tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

  <summary><strong>SortingAlgorithmsVisualizer KMM Compose (iOS & Android)</strong></summary>
  
  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bivvercode/SortingAlgorithmsVisualizer)
  
  SortingAlgorithmsVisualizer is pretty much a self explanatory name. This was my first "completed" hobby project fully public on GitHub. When I was planning this I wanted to do    something "simple" but still could challenge me. The reason for me to keep it simple was because this would be a cross platform app for Android and iOS. I wanted to be able to    test my skills in algorithms and by visualizing it I made it a bit harder.
  The app is using bubble sort as a visualization to show what happens in "the back". This app was made with KMM Compose Multiplatform. Most of the code is written in kotlin and    some minor parts in Swift. This made it possible to use one code base for both Android and iOS.¬†

  <summary><strong>Color Frenzy (Android Group Project)</strong></summary>

    <p>Color Frenzy is made in a group of three. This is a simple game where you have four buttons colored red, yellow, blue, and green. One of the colors will be randomly picked and shown at the top of the screen, and you have to press the correct color. If you press the wrong one, you lose and have to start over. There are three different difficulties, making this a simple game for every age. Then we have the time limit; you have a certain amount of time before you lose. For every point you get, the time will be shorter, making this harder and harder.</p>
    <p>Color Frenzy is made in Android Studio using Kotlin and XML. We worked together using Git through GitHub.</p>

  <summary><strong>Paint Pals (Android)</strong></summary>

  </div>

  Paint Pals was my first Android app and I wanted to do something different than ‚Äùpressing buttons in menus‚Äù. I chose to do a drawing app to test something new. Paint Pals is a simple drawing app, not made for artists. In Paint Pals you can draw with different sizes and colors on your brush. You can also use some premade shapes where you can choose color and size. You can save your drawings to your photo album with or without watermark. It is localized in Swedish and English.

  Paint Pals is created in Android Studio using Kotlin and XML.
